So I've been reading old code lately. Specifically, I've been reading code from a high-school project called **Bobert the Dragon**. It featured a young dragon named Bobert who was out to save the world..or something. It was somewhat of a temporary obsession for me, and I learned Java while writing it. Some friends joined the cause as well after some encouragement - [Andrew Hoskins], [Stuart Ure], Alexa Hrycun and [Rob Winter].

The code is a mess - I'm kind of surprised it works at all.

I've decided to bring out some choice snippets for discussion.
