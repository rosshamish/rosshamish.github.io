do 'retrospectives', where we go back to old code and view it from different levels

- at the function level, and propose/implement better solutions
- at the subsystem level, and propose better organization, better open-close, better abstraction
- at the system level, and propose better architecture, separation of responsibilities

- and include style as well
  - readability
  - naming
  - braces, whitespace, newlines
