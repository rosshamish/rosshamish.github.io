I am currently working with [Andrew Hoskins](http://github.com/ahoskins) on **Winston**: an elegant, intelligent alternative to [Schedule Builder](http://beartracks.ualberta.ca) for students at the [University of Alberta](http://ualberta.ca).

It is currently closed-source, and will be open-sourced on release.
